Data-passionate with a keen interest in innovation and entrepreneurship with 3+ years of experience in the field. I'm fascinated with the pace of advancement of technology. To better understand how AI works and what is it capable of, I decided to pursue a PhD in AI. I'm committed to unravelling the mysteries of the AI "black box".

I currently live in Zurich and I'm learning German to better understand and contribute to the local community.

My hobbies are running and travelling. They clear my mind and help me think out of the box. In addition, I recently discovered Bikram yoga which is currently my new hype.

If you're into making a difference with data, let's get in touch.
